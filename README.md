# Snake: The Game

I continuously want to challenge myself to learn new things, so I have decided to try my hand at making a simple game. The game of Snake has long been a traditional starting point for beginner developers to test their skills and grow. And so, I continue the tradition.

## Challenges

* Create a functioning snake game with the following MVP features:
    * Player can control the direction of the "snake"
    * "Apples" randomly spawn on the map
    * The "snake" can eat the "apples"
    * The "snake" will grow by one every time it eats
    * If a part of the snake hits itself or goes out of bounds, the game ends
* Creating a way to keep score
* Adding start and pause menus
* Adding a high score functionality
    * Find a way to store this data on the cloud
* Export the game to the app store or make it playable as an online application

## The Tutorial

I feel obligated to point out that I am following a tutorial to create this game. The tutorial is found on youtube at the following link:

There are often problems with following along to tutorials, namely that one doesn't actually learn anything and instead copies code verbatim. Not only am I not trying to pass off all of this code as mine, but I am also pointing to this potential short-coming as a way to announce my awareness of it. It is my hope that once I go through the tutorial once, with plenty of notes and researching anything I don't understand, that I will be able to then create a version fully on my own.
